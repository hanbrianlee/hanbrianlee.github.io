Hi!

I'm Brian Lee. I'm a Korean/Canadian aspiring to be the deep learning guru in self driving technologies and humanoids. 

If you'd like to find out more about me, click on [About me/Docs](/docs/) on top where you can find about my experiences, career path, and other hobbies that I enjoy!

If you're interested about some of the Projects (that I can share about in public) that I worked on, please use the Projects dropdown menu at the top navigation menu!

On the right are my blog posts which are just fillers for now but will be updated with my journals on different papers or conferences I attended.
