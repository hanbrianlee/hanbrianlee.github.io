Hi!

I'm Brian Lee. I'm a Korean/Canadian aspiring to be the deep learning guru in self driving technologies and humanoids. 

If you'd like to find out more about me, click on [About me/Docs](/docs/) on top where you can find about my experiences, career path, and other hobbies that I enjoy!

If you're interested about some of the Projects (that I can share about in public) that I worked on, please use the Projects dropdown menu at the top navigation menu!
